The `initial screen` will display all the latest news headlines within India. You can scroll through the page vertically and see them. Each article has an image, a title, a short description, upload date, a `read` and `save` button. On clicking the article content or the `read` button the app will redirect you to the full screen page for that particular article. And if you click the `save` button you will be able to view that news article on a later time in the save screen.
